Multiplatform System Health Monitor for PC.

Autodetects sensors:

- Network usage (+ latency)
- CPU usage & frequency
- RAM usage
- Disk usage, free space **and live read/write throughput**
- CPU temperature - full priority chain: LibreHardwareMonitor/OpenHardwareMonitor → Linux psutil/sysfs → Windows WMI thermal zone → load-based estimate (labelled `~Temp` when inferred)
- GPU usage & temperature (NVIDIA via nvidia-smi, or hardware-monitor backends)
- Fan speeds (hardware monitor / Linux psutil)
- Battery percentage (laptops)

Tiles for optional sensors appear automatically only when the underlying hardware/dependency is available. Install the optional backend once to unlock everything: `pip install wmi` (Windows) and/or run [LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor) for true motherboard sensor values.

## 🧊 Futuristic tiles

Every device group renders as a rounded glass card with a soft accent glow, theme-aware palette and inline sparkline graphs.

## 📌 Widget mode (lives on your desktop)

Right-click the **System Monitor** title and enable **"Widget mode"** to pin the monitor onto the desktop layer itself:

- **Windows** – embedded into the shell's wallpaper layer (same approach as Rainmeter): it sits *behind every window* — never on top of your programs — yet survives *Show Desktop* (Win+D), Win+M and virtual-desktop switches. Explorer restarts are detected and re-embedded automatically.
- **Linux/X11** – desktop-type window: sticky across workspaces, below other windows, no taskbar entry (wmctrl hints where supported).
- **macOS** – normal window kept out of the way (desktop layer needs PyObjC; best-effort).

The setting is remembered in `~/.config/system-monitor/config.json` and restored on the next launch.

You can switch the order of sensor groups. Boasts a theme selector. Save Log will save the active readings into your Documents. The dynamic tiles are now also able to be reorganised upon window resizing.
A config.json file is included to save the window sizing, the selected theme and favorite order.
